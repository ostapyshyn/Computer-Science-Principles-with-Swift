 ## Data Visualization
 
 In the original Visualization playground, you learned an API for visualizing data. In that version of the API, you used functions like `addWedge(proportion:color:)` to set up your visualizations. In this new version, you'll do things a bit differently. In fact, this API strips away a thin abstraction layer—the functions—to expose the underlying interface, which relies on structs, instances, properties, and methods.
 
 To prepare for this playground, you'll want to gather some data to visualize. The process can be as simple as examining an aspect your own life, such as the amount of time you spend on homework for each school subject. Or it can be more complex, such as building a survey and gathering responses. You can also find existing data sets online.

 Before you continue, **make sure the assistant editor is showing the Live View** in the right hand side of the window.
 
 On the next page, you'll get started using pie charts.
