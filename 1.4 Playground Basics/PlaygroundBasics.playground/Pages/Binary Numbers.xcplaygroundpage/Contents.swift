//: ## Binary Numbers
/*:
 You can express binary numbers in a playground too. By using the prefix `0b` in front of a number,
 you indicate to Swift that it's written in binary. Here are some examples.
*/
0b0
0b1
0b100
/*:
 You can use the same mathematical operations you just learned:
 */
0b1000 + 0b10
0b11 - 0b10
0b110 * 0b11
0b1010 / 0b10
//: - experiment:
//:Using your knowledge of how binary numbers work, try counting in binary.\
//:Write the numbers 0 through 10 in binary below.
0b0
0b11
0b111
0b1010

//: - experiment:
//: Now try writing the powers of two from 0 through 20. Can you spot some similarities between the two sequences?
0b10 * 0b10 * 0b10

//: - experiment:
//: Write some larger numbers in binary â€” for instance, your year of birth, the release year of your favorite invention, or the population of your city or country.
