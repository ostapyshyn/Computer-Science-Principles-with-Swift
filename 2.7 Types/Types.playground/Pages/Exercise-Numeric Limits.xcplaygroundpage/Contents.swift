 ## Exercise: Numeric Limits
 
 You've learned that computers represent numbers using a fixed number of bits. On this page, you'll explore more about how this impacts the way numbers work in computation.

 The `Double` type is so called because it refers to a “double-precision floating-point” number. A `Float` type also refers to a number with a decimal point, but the default `Double` is twice as precise.
 
 Below is an example of precision in floating-point numbers. Note that even though the literal assigned to each of the constants below has many digits of precision, the actual number of digits stored by each type is significantly fewer. An exact representation of pi is impossible—it has an infinite number of digits. Nonetheless, your choice of floating-point type will affect your calculations, such as the circumference of a circle on the previous page.

let floatPi: Float = 3.141592653589793238462643383279
let doublePi: Double = 3.141592653589793238462643383279

 Integers also have built-in limits. Most computers use either 32 or 64 bits to store integer types, and this difference is hidden behind the `Int` type in Swift. If you want, you can explicitly choose from several storage sizes for your integers by using one of the following types:
 
 - `Int8`
 - `Int16`
 - `Int32`
 - `Int64`
 
 Each has a maximum and minimum value, stored in the `min` and `max` properties of the type. For instance, `Int16.max` is the maximum possible value of a 16-bit integer in Swift.
 
 - callout(Experiment):
    Find the maximum and minimum values of one of the types above.
 
 */
Int64.max

/*:
 - callout(Experiment):
    Now try adding 1 to the maximum value, or subtracting 1 from the minimum value. What do you think the resulting overflow error means?
 */
Int64.max
