 ## Checking for Characters

 Now that you're eliminating the most common passwords, you can add some more sophisticated checks to your algorithm. A good policy is to disallow plain dictionary words. If you require the user to include nonalphabetic characters, there'll be some amount of randomness even if the password includes dictionary words (such as "apple1984"). You might also require passwords be a minimum length. The longer a password, the longer it takes for a hacker to try all possibilities. For example, there are only 140,608 simple six-letter passwords. In contrast, the number of 16-character passwords generated according to the rules below has an upper bound of over 30 nonillion, or 30 thousand billion billion billion! That's way too many for a hacker to perform an exhaustive search of possible passwords.
 
Use the following rules:
 
 - At least 16 characters
 - At least one regular letter
 - At least one digit
 - At least one punctuation character
 
 The two new arrays below contain the digits and common punctuation characters. Use them in your algorithm.

let tenMostCommonPasswords = [
    "123456",
    "password",
    "12345678",
    "qwerty",
    "12345",
    "123456789",
    "letmein",
    "1234567",
    "football",
    "iloveyou"
]
let digits = "0123456789"
let punctuation = "!@#$%^&*(),.<>;'`~[]{}\\|/?_-+= "

 ### Implement your updated algorithm below.

 - callout(Tip):
 To implement your algorithm, you can treat the password as an array of characters. Use a `for...in` loop to examine all of its characters and to keep a count of digits and punctuation characters. (You can use the `contains()` method you used in `ArraysAndLoops.playground` to help with this.) After checking all the characters in the password, write a final conditional statement to check whether you found at least one of each type of required character.

let password = "password7"

print(password.count)


for char in digits {
    if password.contains(char) {
        print("good")
        
    }
}
