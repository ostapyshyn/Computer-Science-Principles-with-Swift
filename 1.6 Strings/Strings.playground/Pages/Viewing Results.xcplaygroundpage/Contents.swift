//: ## Viewing Playground Results
//: What if you define a long string in a playground? You‚Äôll notice that the longer string is cut off at the end in the results sidebar. üëâ
//:
let spelledOutNumber = "six"
let meal = "breakfast"
let aliceQuotation = "Why, sometimes I‚Äôve believed as many as \(spelledOutNumber) impossible things before \(meal)!"
//: No worries. In the results sidebar, move the cursor over the line that begins ‚ÄúWhy, sometimes I‚Äôve believed‚Ä¶‚Äù When you do, that result will be highlighted and two controls will appear:
//:
//: ![Sidebard Controls](SidebarControls.png)
//: Click the control that looks like an eye. This is the _Quick Look button_. It displays a popover with more of the string value.
//: 
//: Move the cursor over the control that looks like an outlined rectangle. This is the _show result_ button. Click it to add the result of that line of code directly below the code. Click this control again to hide the result.
//:
//: For now, leave the result of the long string showing. Change the values of the spelled-out number and the meal. Notice how the results change inline in the playground.
//:
//: On the next page, take these strings even further.
